Snippets for use in SNUX

[snux](https://github.com/rolflobker/snux) expects snippets in `~/.config/snux/snippets`

Subfolders will be traversed so if you want to combine this with your own snippets put this repo in a subfolder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rolflobker/snux-snippets ~/.config/snux/snippets/public
```
